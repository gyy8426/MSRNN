## From Deterministic to Generative: Multi-Modal Stochastic RNNs for Video Captioning
### Run the code
1. Train a model: python train_model.py </br>
2. Test a trained model: python test.py </br>
### Notes
1. Please make sure the path is correct, when you run the code. </br>
2. The structures of our trained models are listed in: model_\*.py </br>
3. The definition of our Stochastic layer is written in: stochastic_layer.py </br>
4. Before running our codes, please make sure you installed the default deep learning libaries/framework, such as theano and lasagne. </br>
